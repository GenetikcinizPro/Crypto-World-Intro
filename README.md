# **Advantages of Minting NFTs on Tezos Blockchain**

**Cheaper minting cost:** In Tezos blockchain, the cost to mint NFTs is very cheaper than Ethereum. I.e. only 30 to 50 cents. Thanks to its proof-of-stake mechanism. Proof-of-stake algorithm allows Tezos to be faster and consume less energy than what proof-of-work blockchains will consume.

**Decentralization:** Tezos is a decentralized blockchain like Ethereum. It is governed by its own community, not by any centralized organization.

**Security:** Tezos is a security-focused blockchain. Verifications are done at both the protocol and application layers by leveraging the languages OCaml and Michelson, a practice used in mission-critical industries.

**Eco-friendly:** Since Tezos uses a proof-of-stake algorithm, it consumes over 2 million times less energy than proof-of-work blockchains. It is more energy-efficient than Bitcoin and Ethereum.
